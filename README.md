# Color

An AutoHotKey v2.0 library for manipulating Color. Written in C++.

To compile, run `.\compile.ps1` from the root folder of this repository. You will need g++ to compile this.

Move `Color.ahk` and the compiled `Color.dll` to your AutoHotkey library folder, and include this library in your scripts with `#Include <Color>`

Or, if you don't want to compile this yourself, you can find the current Beta release here: [Beta Release](https://github.com/tylerjcw/Color/releases/tag/v0.1.3-Beta)
